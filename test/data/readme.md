# Test Data

This directory contains test data files. The contents are:

* `sample_edited.json` : Some JSON which should be valid. It is dummy data that I edited, so it only contains a subset of the usual data. But I _do_ know what is in there so it can be used to test results explicitly.
* `google_transit.zip` : A ZIP file containing metadata, downloaded on Sept 8 2019 from http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/subway/google_transit.zip
* `feed_*_*sample*.protobuf` : A direct save of the binary response for each feed id. I don't know what's in here but it is a sample of "real" data. I captured one set on a weekend (Sunday) and another on a weekday (Monday) to try and capture some of the possible variance in the data.
